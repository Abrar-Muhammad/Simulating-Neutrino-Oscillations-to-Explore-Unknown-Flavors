# Simulating Neutrino Oscillations to Explore Unknown Flavors

> A computational exploration of extended neutrino flavor states to investigate the sterile neutrino hypothesis.

---

## Abstract

Neutrino oscillations are a quantum mechanical phenomenon where neutrinos change flavors as they propagate. While the standard three-flavor model has strong experimental support, several anomalies suggest the possible existence of a fourth, *sterile* neutrino that does not interact via the weak force.  
This project simulates neutrino oscillation probabilities in both 3-flavor and extended 4-flavor (3+1) frameworks using Python, with the aim of identifying signatures that might support the sterile neutrino hypothesis.

## Objectives

- Model the standard 3-flavor PMNS framework.
- Extend the oscillation model to include a 4th sterile state.
- Simulate and visualize oscillation probabilities over distance and energy.
- Understand how the introduction of a sterile neutrino affects oscillation patterns and flavor transition probabilities.
- Compare both models to highlight observable differences.
- Contribute toward theoretical understanding of beyond-Standard-Model physics.
